# Starbucks Sales Performance Dashboard — Power BI Project
## Project Overview

The Starbucks Sales Performance Dashboard is a comprehensive data analysis project built using Power BI, aimed at understanding and visualizing the overall sales performance, product trends, and store-level insights for Starbucks.
The goal of this project is to convert raw transactional and product data into meaningful and actionable business insights.

This interactive dashboard allows business users, managers, and analysts to explore key sales metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Quantity Sold, Average Sales per Order, and Average Price per Product, along with detailed breakdowns by product category, store location, size, and time period.

Through this project, I have applied my knowledge of data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, relationship creation, and visualization design to build an analytics solution that mirrors real-world retail business reporting.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:
1.	To analyze and visualize sales performance across multiple dimensions such as product type, category, and store location.
2.	To identify top-performing products contributing to the majority of sales revenue.
3.	To examine sales trends over months, quarters, and the entire year to understand seasonal variations.
4.	To highlight average price distribution and the impact of product size on total sales.
5.	To develop an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard that allows dynamic filtering and data exploration.

## **Additional Business Questions for Deeper Insights**

These advanced analytical questions were designed to uncover deeper insights into Starbucks’ business performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency. They help guide further analysis and support strategic decision-making.

1. **How do product returns or order cancellations impact overall profitability?**
   Understanding the effect of returns and cancellations helps identify revenue leakage and operational inefficiencies.

2. **What is the customer purchasing frequency (repeat customers vs. new)?**
   Analyzing repeat purchase patterns reveals customer loyalty levels and helps plan retention strategies.

3. **How effective are seasonal promotions on boosting specific product categories?**
   Measures how discounts or festive offers impact category-level revenue growth.

4. **Which time slots or days of the week generate the highest sales?**
   Identifies peak performance periods for staff scheduling and inventory planning.

5. **Are there cross-selling opportunities between product categories (e.g., Coffee & Bakery)?**
   Helps in bundling strategies and increasing the average transaction value.

6. **How does store location type (e.g., airport, mall, streetfront) influence average sale value?**
   Evaluates which type of store yields the highest profitability.

7. **What’s the trend in sales per employee or footfall per location?**
   Assesses staff productivity and location efficiency to optimize operations.

8. **How does the introduction of new products/SKUs impact existing sales patterns?**
   Determines whether new launches complement or cannibalize existing products.

9. **Which products have the highest growth rate in sales quantity versus value?**
   Identifies fast-moving versus high-margin items for better product mix decisions.

10. **What is the stock-out or lost sales percentage for top SKUs?**
    Highlights supply chain inefficiencies affecting customer satisfaction and revenue.

11. **How do price changes (discounts, markdowns) affect overall demand by product?**
    Evaluates price elasticity to optimize pricing strategies.

12. **Are there differences in sales performance during weekdays vs. weekends?**
    Analyzes sales rhythm to plan marketing campaigns and staffing accordingly.

13. **What customer feedback or review trends can be linked to product performance?**
    Connects sentiment analysis to sales outcomes for improving product quality.

14. **Are there regional or city-specific preferences in product selection?**
    Reveals local taste variations, supporting regional product customization.

15. **How does the average transaction value correlate with customer demographics (if available)?**
    Identifies demographic segments contributing the most to total revenue.

16. **What is the impact of product bundling or combo offers on revenue?**
    Measures the financial success of combo offers and bundled sales promotions.

 These questions can serve as a foundation for future analytical iterations by integrating additional datasets such as customer demographics, loyalty program data, or operational metrics.

# Starbucks Sales Performance Dashboard â€” Power BI Project
## Project Overview

The Starbucks Sales Performance Dashboard is a comprehensive data analysis project built using Power BI, aimed at understanding and visualizing the overall sales performance, product trends, and store-level insights for Starbucks.
The goal of this project is to convert raw transactional and product data into meaningful and actionable business insights.

This interactive dashboard allows business users, managers, and analysts to explore key sales metrics such as Total Revenue, Total Quantity Sold, Average Sales per Order, and Average Price per Product, along with detailed breakdowns by product category, store location, size, and time period.

Through this project, I have applied my knowledge of data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, relationship creation, and visualization design to build an analytics solution that mirrors real-world retail business reporting.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project were:
1.	To analyze and visualize sales performance across multiple dimensions such as product type, category, and store location.
2.	To identify top-performing products contributing to the majority of sales revenue.
3.	To examine sales trends over months, quarters, and the entire year to understand seasonal variations.
4.	To highlight average price distribution and the impact of product size on total sales.
5.	To develop an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard that allows dynamic filtering and data exploration.
